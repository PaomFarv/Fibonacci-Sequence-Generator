# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python script generates Fibonacci numbers up to a user-specified count. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to input the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate. It then iteratively calculates each term in the sequence and outputs it.

### Example Usage

```shell
python fibonacci_generator.py
